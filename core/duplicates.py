"""Duplicate and "different version" detection over raw track records (no Streamlit, no session state).

Two related questions, both answered from raw Spotify records (real Spotify IDs, including the
tracks that had no audio features) rather than from the normalized collection frame:

  - Exact duplicates: the same Spotify ID saved more than once.
  - Different versions: the same song name and primary artist saved under different Spotify IDs
    (separate recordings, remasters, live versions...).

Data shape ("raw frame"): one row per saved occurrence of a track, with columns
track_id (Spotify ID), track_name, artist_name and playlist_name. Build it from the raw session
records (dicts with id / name / artists / playlist_name) with raw_records_frame, then drop
rows without an ID with drop_missing_ids. All functions work on one playlist or on many: pass
only the rows to analyse. Inputs are never mutated.

Used today for one playlist (Playlist Detail). The functions accept an optional
include_playlists flag so a cross-playlist analysis can get, for every group, the list of
playlists it occurs in (one entry per occurrence).
